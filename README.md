212 Weather
A React-based weather application built with Node.js and Express.js that allows users to search for weather information by city, view weather forecasts, and save their preferred city and temperature units. The app also suggests clothing options based on the weather.

Features
Home Page:
Search weather by city with current date, time, and weather parameters.
Choose to view current weather or forecasts for the next 1, 2, or 3 days.
Displays recommended clothing options based on weather conditions.

Sign-up and Sign-in:
Users can create an account and sign in to access the Preferences page.
Authentication is handled locally for demonstration purposes.

Preferences Page:
Allows users to set their preferred city and temperature unit.
Preferences are stored locally and reflected on the Home page.

API Integration:
Uses the Weather API to fetch live weather data.
Clothing recommendations are fetched from a MongoDB Compass database, categorized by weather conditions.

Project Structure
The app follows a modular project structure for better maintainability and scalability:
config/: Contains environment configuration files, such as the database connection settings.
controllers/: Holds the business logic for handling API requests and user interactions.
middlewares/: Stores middleware functions, such as authentication.
models/: Contains database models for user data and clothing options.
routes/: Defines API endpoints and routes for user and weather requests.
views/: HTML templates for the frontend user interface.
utils/: Helper functions and utilities, such as API handlers for the Weather API.
public/: Static assets, including CSS and client-side JavaScript.
app.js: The main application file that initializes the Express server.

Getting Started
