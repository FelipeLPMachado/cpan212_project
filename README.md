Weather app description:

The weather application provides users with real-time weather updates and forecasts for their chosen locations. Users can search for cities to view current weather conditions, including temperature, humidity, and wind speed. The app also offers a 7-day or 14-day weather forecast, showcasing detailed daily information such as maximum and minimum temperatures, weather conditions, and chances of precipitation. Unfortunately, only paid weather APIs allow for forecasts extending beyond 3 days. With an intuitive interface that includes a search bar, forecast toggle, and responsive weather display, users can easily navigate and customize their weather experience, ensuring they stay informed about weather changes in their area, making it a valuable tool for planning daily activities.
